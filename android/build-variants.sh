# Build the release variants of ARMSX3.
#
# ARMSX3 ships four APKs. The split is by platform level and ISA baseline -- the core is
# arm64-only in all four:
#
#   legacy  API 30 (Android 11), armv8.1-a               the fallback, and the FLOOR the code
#                                                        compiles at: util/simd.hpp uses SQRDMLAH
#                                                        (v8.1 RDMA) and util/asm.hpp has inline
#                                                        LSE atomics, so armv8-a does not build.
#                                                        Its value is devices whose cores are 8.2
#                                                        WITHOUT the optional fp16/dotprod that the
#                                                        other three builds require.
#                                                        (Cortex-A53/A57/A73) have neither
#                                                        dotprod nor FP16, so this stays at the
#                                                        8.1 baseline and keeps only LSE atomics.
#   a11     API 30 (Android 11), armv8.2-a+dotprod+fp16
#   a13     API 33 (Android 13), armv8.2-a+dotprod+fp16  the standard build; 8 Gen 1 and later
#   a15     API 35 (Android 15), armv8.2-a+dotprod+fp16  current devices
#
# The three 8.2 builds differ ONLY in platform level, so they generate the same code and exist
# to widen the floor, not to go faster than each other. What a higher API buys is what the
# platform itself provides -- native ELF TLS from 29 up being the one that touches the emulator
# core -- so a device should install the highest variant it can run.
#
# +fp16 was briefly suspected of breaking Batman: Arkham City and is cleared. That failure was
# the Qualcomm proprietary driver running the device out of memory -- RAM climbed monotonically
# to 7.1GB and lowmemorykiller took the process, with no signal in any log. The same build is
# fine on Turnip. See the per-vkCmdEndRenderPass leak note in vkutils/device.cpp.
#
# All three build with NDK 29. The NDK is not a device-compatibility knob -- what gates devices
# is the API level and -march, and a device cannot tell which toolchain produced its binary. NDK
# 28 was tried for the older two and does not compile this tree at all: fmt::throw_exception is a
# class whose constructor and destructor are [[noreturn]], and clang 19 (NDK 28) does not
# propagate that through a temporary, so every function ending in a throw fails with "does not
# return a value in all control paths". Clang 21 (NDK 29) handles it. Satisfying the older
# compiler would mean adding unreachable returns across upstream code and re-doing it on every
# merge, for a toolchain that generates worse code anyway.
#
# On the ISA: LSE atomics come from the 8.1 baseline, so every variant has them. dotprod and
# FP16 are named explicitly on the 8.2 builds because 8.2 makes neither mandatory -- dotprod
# only becomes so at 8.4. That is a hard floor, not a preference: those instructions can appear
# anywhere in the C++ and a device without them faults rather than falling back, which is the
# whole reason the generic variant exists.
#
# Each core lives in its own build directory and shares no objects with the others. Every one
# is a full LLVM + RPCS3 build from cold, so all three together run for hours. They are built
# one after another on purpose: concurrent ninja jobs thrash each other and finish slower than
# in sequence.
#
# Usage:
#   android/build-variants.sh                 # all three
#   android/build-variants.sh a13             # one
