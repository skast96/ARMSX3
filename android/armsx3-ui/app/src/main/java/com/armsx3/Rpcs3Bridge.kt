/**
 * Translation layer between ARMSX2's [NativeApp] surface and RPCS3.
 *
 * NativeApp exists to keep ARMSX2's 129-file UI compiling unchanged. This is
 * where the two models are actually reconciled, and they differ in ways that
 * matter:
 *
 *  - PAD INPUT. ARMSX2 sends per-button edges (setPadButton(index, range,
 *    pressed)). RPCS3 takes the WHOLE pad state every call
 *    (overlayPadData(digital1, digital2, lx, ly, rx, ry)). So we hold the
 *    state here and push a full snapshot on every change - forwarding one
 *    button in isolation would clear every other button that was held.
 *
 *  - SETTINGS. ARMSX2 addresses a PCSX2 INI by (section, key). RPCS3 has a
 *    typed config tree addressed by a "@@"-joined path, and its setter takes a
 *    JSON-encoded value.
