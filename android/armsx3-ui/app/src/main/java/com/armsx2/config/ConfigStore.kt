 * Persistence + resolution for emu [Settings].

 * Two storage tiers, both in `MainActivityRuntime.prefs`:
 *   - **Global** under `config.global` — the user's baseline. Stored as a
 *     full Settings JSON.
 *   - **Per-game** under `config.game.<serial>` — sparse JSON containing
 *     ONLY the fields the user explicitly overrode for that title. Sparse
 *     storage means future global tweaks still flow through fields the
 *     user hasn't touched per-game.
 *
 * [resolveForGame] is the only method anyone outside the settings UI
 * should call. It returns the merged Settings to push at VM launch.
 *
 * No caching — load on demand. Writes are rare (user clicked Save) and
 * reads happen at game launch (once per launch). Both well within
 * SharedPreferences' overhead.

/**
 * Where overlay setting changes land. The overlay header picks one at
 * runtime via a switch; default is [Game] when a game is loaded,

 *
 *   - [Global] writes the full Settings to `config.global`. Affects every
 *     future game launch that doesn't have its own per-game override.
 *   - [Game] writes the SPARSE diff (only fields differing from current
 *     global) to `config.game.<serial>`. Global stays untouched; only
