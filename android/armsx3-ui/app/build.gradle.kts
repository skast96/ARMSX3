// ARMSX3 UI module.
//
// ARMSX2's Compose UI running on the RPCS3 core. Deliberately much simpler than
// ARMSX2's own build file, which is replaced wholesale rather than edited:
//
//  * externalNativeBuild builds ONLY the JNI glue (src/main/cpp), which is small.
//    The emulator CORE is a prebuilt libarmsx3-core.so (upstream RPCS3 via
//    android/configure.sh) that the glue dlopen()s at runtime -- building that
//    from Gradle would drag LLVM into every sync.
//  * NO Discord SDK staging. That path requires DISCORD_SDK_DIR pointed at a
//    hand-staged directory or Kotlin will not compile at all, and it is not on
//    the critical path for standing the UI up.
//  * NO product flavors, no PGO, no dual page-size cores - all PCSX2-specific.
//
// The source package stays com.armsx2 on purpose: renaming 129 files buys
// nothing and risks silent breakage. applicationId is what identifies the app.

// ARMSX3: fail the build if the bundled ANGLE libraries are not there.
//
// This check exists because of a specific, expensive bug in ARMSX2: the repo's
// blanket `*.so` gitignore rule swallowed the ANGLE prebuilts, they never made it
// into release staging, the APK shipped without them, and the core fell back to
// the system GLES driver in complete silence. Users reported "ANGLE is broken"
// and there was nothing in any log to contradict them.
//
// jniLibs/.gitignore un-ignores the two files by name. This task is the second
// lock: packaging an APK that claims to support ANGLE without shipping ANGLE is a
// build error, not a runtime surprise. The core-side counterpart is the loud error
// in gl::es::egl_initialize() when the override library is selected but cannot be
// dlopen'd; the UI-side counterpart is the MISSING_LIBS line that
// MainActivityRuntime.applyAngleEnv logs when the option is on and the .so is not
// in nativeLibraryDir.
//
// The claim being guarded is live in THIS module: RendererBackendSection ->
// AngleDriverSection writes Settings.useAngleOpenGL, and applyAngleEnv turns it
// into ARMSX2_ANGLE_EGL_LIBRARY. (Both the libraries and this task used to sit in
// the stale android/armsx3-app module, which builds nothing that ships -- so the
// guard could not fire for the APK it was meant to protect.)
