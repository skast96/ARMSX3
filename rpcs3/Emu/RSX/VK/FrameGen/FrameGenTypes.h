// Compatibility shim for code ported from Eden (eden-emu PR #4263).
//
// The port is deliberately kept close to the original so upstream fixes stay easy to follow.
// Eden is a yuzu descendant and leans on two things PCSX2 does not have: an `f32` scalar alias,
// and a `Settings::values.*` configuration object. Rather than rewriting every use of those
// across ~3000 lines, they are provided here once.
//
// LICENSING: Eden is GPL-3.0-or-later and PCSX2 is GPL-3.0+, so this code may be combined.
// Note this is NOT true of RPCS3, which is GPL-2.0-only — do not carry these files there.
