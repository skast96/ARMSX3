// Frame generation (Lossless Scaling) as seen by the renderer.
//
// The implementation lives in libarmsx3_lsfg.so and is reached by dlopen, never by linking. That
// is not a packaging preference: framegen statically links volk, which defines 655 globals named
// vkCreateImage, vkQueueSubmit, ... including all 124 that rpcs3/Emu/RSX/VK/vk_android_loader.h
// declares for our own renderer. Link them together and either the link fails, or the symbols
// merge and framegen's volkLoadDevice() silently repoints our entire renderer at framegen's
// VkDevice. See 3rdparty/lsfg/armsx3_lsfg_shim.h.
//
// Everything here is a no-op returning false off Android, or when the library is absent, or when
// the user has not supplied the shaders. Callers do not need to check the platform.
