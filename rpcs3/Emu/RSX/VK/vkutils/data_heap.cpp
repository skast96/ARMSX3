		// because every other thread is fine. Sonic '06 dies this way, Ratchet & Clank dies at
		// 144MB in this same function, and neither failure names the heap without the growth log
		// below.
		//
		// Growing into a size the device cannot satisfy is never right: the allocation is
		// guaranteed to fail, and the swap-out path below is the correct answer instead. Bound
		// the ceiling by free memory so that decision gets made before the fatal allocation
		// rather than after it. A quarter of what is free leaves room for the copy, since the
		// old heap is still resident while the new one is created.

		// A hard ceiling, because free memory is not the constraint that matters.

		// The first attempt bounded this by utils::get_avail_memory()/4 and did nothing: that
		// reads MemAvailable, which counts reclaimable page cache, so it reported ~2.5GB while
		// the driver would not grant a single 576MB device allocation. "Memory the kernel could
		// reclaim" and "memory the GPU can have in one contiguous block" are different numbers.
		//
		// So bound it by what the ring can plausibly need instead. Sonic '06 climbs
		// 192->256->320->384->448->512->576MB in seven seconds while its LARGEST request in that
		// span is 217K -- three orders of magnitude smaller. A ring that has reached 256MB is
		// already far past serving its traffic and is growing for some other reason; letting it
		// keep going only decides how long before an allocation fails.
		//
		// Reaching the limit is not fatal: the branch below swaps the heap out instead, which is
		// the behaviour we want and never got to because the allocation died first.
